#Description 
The admin section of this project has been developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The backend functionality is implemented using Node.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for managing the administrative tasks. The frontend is built with React.js, offering a dynamic and interactive user interface for the admin section. MongoDB is utilized as the database to store and manage the admin-related data. The admin section allows for efficient management of various aspects of the application, such as user accounts, product inventory, order processing, and other administrative functionalities. By leveraging the MERN stack, this admin section ensures seamless integration between the backend and frontend, providing a comprehensive solution for managing the ecommerce platform.
